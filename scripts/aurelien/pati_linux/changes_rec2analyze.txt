!!! This program is under strong development.
Together with Adam, Marcel, Aart and Paul a improved version will be developed.
If you want to get the latest version or help, please send me an email.
From time to time this version will be updated

Please let me know features you miss.

05.08: Larger changes to allow diffusion scans be converted.

     - Some additional bug-fixes and further output (Thanks to Adam and Marcel)
     - Thanks to Aart for testing and some test files
