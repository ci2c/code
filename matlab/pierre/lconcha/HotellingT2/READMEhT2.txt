HOTELLINGT2 gives several Hotelling T-Squared testing procedures for multivariate samples.
Them include one-sample and two-sample (dependent and independent [it test whether they are
heteroscedastic or homoscedastic]).

Usage

1. It is necassary you have defined on Matlab the X - data matrix 
(For each case, please see the help topic.). 

2. For running this file it is necessary to call the HotellingT2 function as
hotellingt2(X,alpha) [alpha-significance level default = 0.05].

3. Immediately it will ask you by directed arguments which is your 
multivariate test of interest. 

4. Once you input your choices, it will appear your results.
