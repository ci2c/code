   models of cortical oscillations: From Kuramoto to the nonlinear
   FokkerÂ­Planck equation. Frontiers in Neuroscience 4: 190.

Kuramoto0D.m implements a fully-connected Kuramoto model with no spatial properties.
Kuramoto1D.m implements a 1D array of Kuramoto oscillators.
Kuramoto2Dw.m implements a 2D array of Kuramoto oscillators.
HanselMato2Dw.m implements a 2D array of Hansel-Mato oscillators.

Each program (eg Kuramoto0D.m) comes with a demonstration script
(eg Kuramoto0DDemos.m) that shows how to use it.
